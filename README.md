# TestCasesDesignAndBugReport_QR_Code_Generation

I tested all the parts:

1. Verify that the data entry process is smooth, and the information is accurately captured.
2. Validate the speed and efficiency of the QR code generation process.
3. Assess the performance of the application by simulating a large number of concurrent users.
4. Monitor and report any performance bottlenecks or latency issues.
5. Write maximum 2-3 design issues.
6. Write down if you have any suggestions for this application improvements.
